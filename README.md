# DeBruijn Graph and Eulerian Path

The purpose of this project is to construct the Debruijn graph given a set of sequences, and to determine the Eulerian path in said graph, if one exists.

DeBruijn graphs are common solution to de novo sequence assembly problems- where base-pair or amino acid sequences are assembled to reconstruct genomes or proteins.
